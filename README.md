This is a tutorial which I wrote for Fortran 90 (and beyond). It was written
to accompany a presentation which I did for younger students at my university.
It is directed at an audience which already knows how to program, but has no
experience with scientific programming or Fortran. It is only meant to get them
started with the language and is by no means comprehensive.

For the example programs which I wrote, see ./src. For the output which is
expected, see ./output. For a copy of the original tutorial I wrote and a
PDF containing the source code, see ./doc. A complete and updated tutorial
can be found in the repository wiki.
